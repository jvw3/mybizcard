            I'm a self-motivated, team oriented, algorithmic thinker with a
            passion for learning, and a strength for working in a high pressure,
            fast-paced, environment. I've recently made the transition to
            software development after playing professional football for the
            last seven years. I'm accustomed to comprehending a variety of new
            concepts in a short period of time and I'm seeking a position to expand
            and leverage my strengths.
